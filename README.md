# CursoProgramacionWeb
These practices are part of the Software Engineering Web Programming course.

## Práctica 1
This is a small web page that simulates a previous version of the LOL page.
The main purpose of this practice was to build only the HTML page, but it contains some JS functions that add functionality to some buttons.

## Práctica 3
The main purpose of this practice was to create new objects (div) in the DOM and be able to modify their properties.
- You need to select an object to be able to modify its properties.
- When you select an object...
	- the object's style border has to change to the dotted style.
	- its current properties have to be indicated in the modifiers.

The object's style properties related to color, return their current value in RGB format so it must be converted to hexadecimal format, because the value that you want to specify in inputs (object) must be in hexadecimal format.

	function convertirHex(x)
	input = it must be in RGB format (rgb(255, 0, 0))
	output = it will return in hexadecimal format (#FF0000)
